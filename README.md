# cm-vite

Dynamic imports transformer and path rewriter for Vitejs when using [CoreMedia](https://www.coremedia.com/) Frontend Workspace for Blueprints.

Vitejs can already handle javascript or stylesheets perfectly and this project tries to implement the existing webpack plugins as vite plugins. 
This includes:

- [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/) templates
- Theme Upload and Share API
- Liverload 

## CoreMedia

- [on GitHub](https://github.com/CoreMedia)
- [Homepage](https://www.coremedia.com/)

> You will probably need permissions to access the repository from the frontend workspace.

## Vitejs

[Next Generation Frontend Tooling](https://vitejs.dev/)

> Get ready for a development environment that can finally catch up with you.
