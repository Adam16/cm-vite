# Security Policy

This project values the independent community and believes that responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of all our users.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a vulnerability, please submit a report with proof of concept. We ask that you do not use other channels or contact project contributors directly. 

Non-vulnerability related security issues, such as great new ideas for security features, are welcome on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Adam16/cm-vite/issues).
